#### Meteor is a full stack web application framework for the JavaScript language. It runs in a NodeJS environment.

## What problem does it solve?
  
* Seemlessly ties the frontend and backend together. 
* Takes much of the complexity out of full stack development with JavaScript
* Build Advanced Apps quickly with a small team
* More function with less code

#### A good anology is Meteor is like the Rails of JavaScript frameworks, whereas the MEAN Stack would be Sinatra.
